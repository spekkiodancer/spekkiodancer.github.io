This is a recorded jounery of my progress in developing my personal projects. I have many ideas that I want to execute, but I will start with my first project: a pdf reader. I want to create a tool that can find text from a pdf file without having to open it. Ideally, it can do quick search, queries, and regular expressions. The programming language I will be using is Python. Later, I will be using C++ for some of the features.
